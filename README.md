This project is to identify the probabilty for each node in the bayesian network, though the construction of bayesian it not from code, which is from GeNIe 4.1 Academic version. 

## description 
We are trying to quantify the risk of interdependent infrastructure in the city, under the risk of flooding and cyber attack. The case study is some borough in London. The methods is through data science and machine learning. 

## root hazards node 
the root node is for predicting the probability of flooding and cyber attack. We use linear regression, SARIMA to predict the flooding probabilty in England based on the real flooding data, in flood_warnings.xlsx
